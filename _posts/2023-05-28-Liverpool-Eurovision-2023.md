title: "Liverpool/Eurovision 2023"
---

I went to Eurovision! After over a decade of following/blogging/podcasting about the contest, it was long overdue to get there in person. Technically this should have happened in 2020, but...uh...stuff happened.

This is mostly chronological, but I've grouped some larger stuff (being a tourist, meeting some of the Eurovision artists, ᵗᵃᵏᶦⁿᵍ ˢᵉˡᶠᶦᵉˢ, you know) together at the start and end of this.

## Sightseeing in Liverpool

I got into town a few days before I could go to the Press Center but also a day after any of the meet & greet stuff I would have wanted to go to would have been happening. Such is scheduling sometimes. It was nice to get the lay of the land in Liverpool, and this includes multiple days worth of gallivanting around, including:

- Wandering around after dropping my stuff off in Liverpool
- a Beatles tour we took as part of a package deal that included the British Music Experience (below) and a ride on the :::eyes go black, gameshow voice starts::: *Wheel! of! Liverpool!*
- a trip to the Tate Liverpool with a friend from Twitter, [Dudepoints](https://dudepoints.fun/) and their partner
- wandering over to where the Cavern Club was Thursday of Eurovision Week
- making one last run to the Really Good Bakery before All Of The Travel Home

## Soloveiko Songborbs

One of the most brilliant pieces of UK/raine content in the city were these inflatable birds, representing the soloveiko, one of Ukraine's symbols. Each ~~bird~~ borb has different markings, representing a different Ukrainian handicrafts pattern. I love them and still want some sort of squishy version OR full set of Christmas ornaments of them all.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/2_soloveiko-songbirds" %}

## British Music Experience

As mentioned, as part of a package deal for Eurovision tourists, we got a trip to the nearby British Music Experience. They had some choice Eurovision-related content, and a bunch of things that made me smile as a huge music nerd.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/3_british-music-experience" %}

Here's that last panorama in its full beauty - I really loved this piece by the group Dorothy in the BME's cafe:
<p align="center"><a href="/assets/images/eurovision2023/9 - Pop Music.jpeg"><img src="/assets/images/eurovision2023/9 - Pop Music.jpeg" width="1000"></a></p>

## Blue & Yellow Submarine Parade

Also happening in town as part of the fun: a locally organized parade turning the Beatles' "Yellow Submarine" into a blue and yellow submarine to represent Ukraine. This was deeply chaotic in the way that the best local parades are.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/4_yellow-submarine-parade" %}

## The Turquoise Carpet

On Sunday of Eurovision Week, we went from watching the start of the Eurovision Red Carpet in our rented flat to realizing (after getting into the area where the National Lottery's Big Eurovision Welcome concert would be held) that we could watch the tail end of it in person. We posted up by the gates and I snapped a decent chunk of the artists as they got to the end of the carpet, AND we ended up in the background of what was later broadcast as a cut-down version of the contest on the BBC.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/5_turquoise-carpet" %}

## National Lottery's Big Eurovision Welcome

This was a lot of fun. Props to Frankie Goes to Hollywood for reuniting for the first time in 36 years to ONLY play "Welcome to the Pleasuredome". Icons.

Not pictured here: getting to see everyone's brain IMMEDIATELY retrieve the full lyrics to "Mr. Brightside" as soon as the opening guitar line started while they were warming up the crowd.

Also in this batch: yes, that person at the concert that looks like Lizzie from Bake Off IS in fact Lizzie from Bake Off and will gladly listen to three Americans fawn over the show at them.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/6_big-eurovision-welcome" %}

## Press Center and SF1 Media Rehearsal

I should _probably_ mention that I not only had tickets to two of the semifinal dress rehearsals, I also had (fan) media credentials to cover the contest behind the scenes. 
I've done my best to crop out any screens we were Prohibited from Filming, but getting to see these performances in full and see what each delegation was going for was really special, and I hope the podcast can do that again in the future.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/7_sf1-media-dress" %}

## SF1 "Jury" Show

We could only get the "VIP" tickets for the first semifinal by the time I got to the front of the ticket queue, and our group went for it, which meant that we got fed some really nice catering and had plenty of Free Wine, the best wine.

This was great because it was a chance to see how the various acts played with a crowd in place, and you could start to see who the favorites were likely to be by the end of the week.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/8_sf1-jury-show" %}

## SF2 Media Rehearsal

Same stuff, different day, new crop of artists. This was Wednesday of Eurovision week - between this and the jury show, I popped over to the Eurovillage to see Käärijä play a set.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/9_sf2-media-dress" %}

## The Eurovillage

This is two different trips to the Eurovillage on Wednesday and Thursday of Eurovision Week, both to see some of the acts play live AND to get my hands on as much food from the Discover Ukraine section of things as I could.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/10_eurovillage" %}

## SF2 "Jury" Show

Even though there were no jury scores for the semifinals this year, the "Evening Preview" shows will always be the jury shows in my heart and brain. Once again: the way things play to a not-that-full room full of journalists and the way things play to an arena full of locals and Eurofans is entirely different, and being on the arena floor provided an entirely different vantage point.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/11_sf2-jury-show" %}

## The Grand Final

Our group struck out on getting tickets to the grand final, so these are shots from the media rehearsal of the show (which kicked off with a stage manager walking the artists through the flag parade for the first time) and from watching the final in the Press Center with the rest of media.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/12_grand-final" %}

## Artist Interactions

I grouped these all together even though they took place over the course of the week:
- seeing KEiiNO in the Euroclub
- hanging out by Käärijä's sauna truck while he did press
- Daði Freyr's ice cream giveaway
- checking out the sauna truck after the grand final and spotting his doppelganger/entourage member Häärijä

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/13_artist-interactions" %}

## Selfies and Photos with Friends

I took a LOT of selfies on this trip? I took a lot of selfies on this trip. There's also photographic proof of:
- meeting Käärijä after the SF1 family show (he liked my jacket)
- meeting Daði Freyr at his ice cream truck
- having a podcaster meet-up
- spotting friends outside the shows on the way out or in the press center
- celebrating part of 12 Points From America (Sam Ross') upcoming nuptials with a hen do before SF2 media day 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/gallery/eurovision-2023/14_selfies-and-friends" %}

and that's it!
