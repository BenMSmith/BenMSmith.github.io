This is basically an invention exchange?  Happy Turkey Day, all!

Knowing that this year's marathon was going to be overstuffed and "surgically-enhanced" (by digitally upscaling the episodes), I wanted to do something that saluted this by mashing up one Turkey Day tradition with another Minnesotan icon: Tater Tot Hotdish

Taking all my Friendsgiving trimmings that were still hanging around in the fridge and layering them together in an optimum order (stuffing, cranberries, turkey, green beans, and crispy spuds) with some extra french fried onions and gravy on the side makes for a fantastic fridge-clearer.

It's all about balance, so there needs to be some acid to balance out all the brown starches.  You could use some whole-berry cranberry sauce for this, but I rely on my family's cranberry-orange relish, which is an easy 1-1-1 ratio of bags of cranberries, oranges, and cups of sugar (though I typically only use 2/3 cup of sugar for extra sharpness).  The first two get roughly chopped in the food processor, and then the sugar is added and everything left for a few hours to macerate.

First: gather your leftovers!  I had stuffing, turkey, and cranberries left over from Friendsgiving, but picked up a box of Stove Top in case I couldn't completely cover the bottom of my baking dish, and listened to the part of my brain that was screaming "IT NEEDS A GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE LAYER" and made a night-before-Turkey-Day trip to get a few cans of green beans and some cream of mushroom.

Then comes the layering:  start with stuffing, then the cranberry sauce, then turkey and gravy,then green beans and mushroom soup.

Then, finally, a crown of tater tots and, if you'd like, some cheddar.  I grew up in a Midwestern household so cheese is not optional.

Bake it all together at 400 for 45 minutes (or until everything's crispy on top and bubbling below), then let it cool for 20 minutes before diving in.
