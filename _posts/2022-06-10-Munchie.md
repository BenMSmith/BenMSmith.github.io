Folks?  I think this one did psychic damage.  I am apparently cursed (or possibly blessed) to be experiencing the _Munchies_ family of Quality Film Products in reverse order, having watched 1994's _Munchie Strikes Back_ at my local bad movie night, Trash Night, in early 2019.  At this rate, I'm scheduled to watch _Munchies_ in 3 years.  I typically do a re-watch of the episode a few days after the premiere for recipe purposes, but didn't immediately jump back into watching _Munchie_, largely because it felt like I was _still watching Munchie the first time around._  This one hit _hard_.

This is the rare episode that I had an if-all-else-fails idea for before watching things.  _Munchie_ felt like it would lend itself well to a sort of kitchen-sink 420-esque all-of-the-junk-foods-at-once kind of snacky thing, and it also felt like a nice time to trot out a bar, as I'm Midwestern (Minnesotan, even) and we have a big Bar Culture for things like this, don't-cha-know.  So I wanted to do a blondie with a bunch of munchies mixed in, with some beer just for kicks.

And then it hit me, mid-movie, the first time through:

So for that, I'm sorry. I tried to make something nice, but apparently this movie's really sunken in deep.  Let's talk about how to make these delicious bars ᵗʰᵉ ᵉˣᵃᶜᵗ ˢʰᵃᵈᵉ ᵒᶠ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵘʳˢᵉ́ᵈ ʳᵒᶜᵏᵃᶠᶦʳᵉ ᵉˣᵖˡᵒˢᶦᵒⁿ ʳᵉʲᵉᶜᵗ!
