These are a recipe from Flour, a local bakery. I make them better because the cookie is smaller and the glaze has more lime juice so there’s more of an interplay between sweet and sour.

Flour often makes two of these into an oreo/moon pie sort of a deal with some creme in the middle. You could do that too, if you wanted.

This makes 28-32 cookies

##Ingredients

###for the cookies

- 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 3/4 cup + 2 Tbsp (175 grams) granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons finely grated lime zest (about 4 limes)
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups (280 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup (100 grams) medium-coarse yellow cornmeal
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt

###for the glaze:

- 1 cup (140 grams) powdered sugar
- 3 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 1/2 tsp finely grated lime zest (1-2 limes)

##Steps

1. Position a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 350F
2. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a handheld mixer), cream together the butter and granulated sugar on medium speed for about 5 minutes (10 minutes with a handheld mixer). Yes, that’s a long time, you want this to get super light and fluffy. Stop the mixer a few times and use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and the paddle to release any clinging butter and sugar.
3. Add the lime zest and beat on medium speed for about 1 minute to release the lime flavor. Add the eggs and vanilla and continue to beat on medium speed for 2-3 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Scrape the bowl and paddle again to ensure the eggs are fully incorporated.
4. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. With your mixer on low speed, slowly add the flour mixture to the butter-sugar mixture and then mix until the flour is completely incorporated and the dough is evenly mixed.
5. Drop the dough into 2 Tbsp portions (I use a medium-sized cookie scoop for this) onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand.
6. Bake for about 17-18 minutes, or until the cookies are pale brown on the edges and just firm to the touch in the center. Be sure not to overbake the cookies until the tops are browned.
7. Let cool on the baking sheet for 15-20 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool to room temperature for glazing. If the cookies are too warm, your glaze won’t stick.
8. Make the glaze: while the cookies are cooling, in a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, lime juice, and lime zest until smooth. You should have about 1/2 cup of glaze.
9. Brush the cookies with a thin layer of the glaze, then allow to set for 10 minutes before serving or storing.

The cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The unbaked dough can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.
