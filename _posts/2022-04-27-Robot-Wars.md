title: "We’ve Got Cookie Sign: Robot Wars (S13E2)"
---

Another new month, another new MST3k, and another recipe to go with it!

The second episode of this season is Robot Wars, a Full Moon Entertainment special starring Barbara Crampton. It has everything you’d want: scorpion-esque robot transportation, the same set dressed as multiple different locations, and Crystal Vista, a village preserved as it was at the time of the 1993 “Great Toxic Gas Scare”. It’s VERY cheesy, and VERY 90s, and that’s what got me to this month’s cookie.

What’s the most 90s cookie you can think of?

No, _not_ SnackWells.

I refuse to reverse-engineer SnackWells on this blog.

**Time’s up**! The answer is Dunkaroos, the lunchbox snack where you essentially got to dip cookies in cake frosting:

Midway through watching Robot Wars for the second time, the phrase “Savory Dunkaroos” entered my brain and then I needed to make it a reality. What would a savory dunkaroo need to have?

- small graham-y or shortbread-y cookies, ideally stamped with some kind of design
- a thick, frosting-y dip of some kind.

Given how _truly_ cheesy this movie is, it made sense to make the cookies cheesy as well, so I dug up a smoked gouda cookie recipe from Dorie Greenspan, and to balance that out, I made a dip from my favorite chimichurri-esque sauce from Joshua McFadden’s Six Seasons by adding some avocado and greek yogurt.

These turned out great – the cheesiness of the cookies balances perfectly with the super herby-y dip, and the orange and green color scheme is very 90s Nickelodeon’s whole Memphis-y vibe.

Making the dip starts with toasting and grinding some coriander, cumin, and cardamon seeds. Toasting brings out the flavors a little more, so don’t skip this step. I use a cheap $10 coffee grinder from Amazon for grinding spices (and ONLY grinding spices), but you could also use a mortar and pestle here.

_Making green dip, layer by layer. I used two small avocados here instead of one large one._

The sauce comes together in layers – first you chop the peppers and garlic, then add the cilantro and parsley and let that get all chopped up, then add the lemon and spices. This all gets finished off with olive oil, and then, since we want this to be a dip, some avocado. I later thinned this out with a few spoonfuls of greek yogurt to balance out the avocado with some extra “tang”.

The cookie dough also comes together in the food processor. Start out with the smoked gouda (and this doesn’t need to be fancy – I’m using the $3.99 grocery store special here), butter, cheddar, and cayenne, pulsing to small curds, then add the flour and keep pulsing until you get larger popcorn-y curds that start to form your dough ball.

Once that’s in place, that gets split into two “patties” you can roll out to 1/4 inch thickness, place between layers of parchement, and let hang out in the fridge for 4-5 hours to firm up. You can also cheat by putting this in the freezer for one.

Each of the slabs then gets rolled out and cut into as many cookies as you can with a 1 1/2 inch diameter biscuit cutter. I have some cookie stamps, so I stamped each of these as well for that Dunkaroos feel. Once you’ve cut cookies out of each slab, knead the dough together, re-roll, and repeat the process, chilling the slab for 10 minutes as needed.

Each sheet of these bakes for 16-18 minutes and comes out slightly puffed and golden. Let them cool on the sheet for a few minutes, then finish cooling on a rack.

Et voila! A fancy savory version of the 90s classic, perfect for noshing on while you sit through that Crystal Vista Timeshare meeting.

What do you think, Mads?
