title: "We’ve Got Cookie Sign: Gamera vs. Jiger (S13E7)"

Sometimes, things fall apart, like the initial plan of what you wanted to do for a movie.

I've still _got_ that idea for a Gamera-inspired treat, it'll just have to happen another time.  On the plus side, my inability to not click spoiler tags meant that I had a great direction to go as a backup.  Thanks, GregC!

So, it's been ridiculously hot in the Northeast up until a few days ago, which meant that even if I enjoyed candy-making (I don't - it's... _fussy_ ...in a way that doesn't work with how I like to bake), it was not the time to bring out the candy thermometer and make my already-warm kitchen even less pleasant to be in while working on a treat.  Luckily, I've had a local bakery's cookie I've been trying to work out for myself.

Flour is a chain of (fantastic) local bakeries here in Boston, and one of my favorites to pair with a cup of coffee is their double-chocolate cookie, which they've lately started making with rye flour (yay, whole grains!  these are now slightly healthier!) which adds some extra nuttiness.  Those typically come baked with walnuts, so it wasn't too hard to swap those out for the traditional pecans of a turtle-flavored anything, and the saltiness of a miso caramel felt like it would add a nice balance for all the fudgy richness the cookies already had going on.

## Double-Chocolate Miso Caramel Turtle Cookies


### Ingredients

#### Cookies
- ¾ cup (90 grams) walnut halves
- 9 ounces (255 gram) bittersweet chocolate
- 6 ounces (170 grams) unsweetened chocolate
- ½ cup or 1 stick (115 grams) unsalted butter
- ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups (300 grams) sugar
- 4 large eggs (about 200 grams), at room temperature
- ½ cup (60 grams) rye flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt

#### Miso Caramel Drizzle
-

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and position a rack in the center of the oven. Place the walnuts on a baking sheet and toast for 8 to 10 minutes, until they start to smell fragrant and are lightly golden brown when you break one in half. Remove them from the oven and let cool. Roughly chop them and set aside.

2. Chop 5 ounces of the bittersweet chocolate and 4 ounces of the unsweetened chocolate into large chunks and place them with the butter in a metal or heatproof glass bowl. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water and heat, stirring occasionally, until completely smooth. Remove from the heat, whisk in the vanilla, and let cool for about 20 minutes so it’s not piping hot.

3. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk together the sugar and eggs for about 5 minutes on medium-high speed, until light and thick and pale yellow. With the mixer on low, slowly add the chocolate-butter mixture and whisk for about 15 seconds. It will not be completely mixed at this point but that’s okay, because you will finish combining all the ingredients by hand.

4. Chop the remaining 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate into 1-inch chunks and shave the remaining 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate into fine shavings. In a medium bowl, stir together the rye flour, the chopped bittersweet chocolate, shaved unsweetened chocolate, baking powder, salt, and toasted walnuts. Remove the bowl from the mixer, add the rye flour mixture, and fold it in by hand until the dough is completely homogeneous.

5. For best results, scrape the dough into an airtight container and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 to 4 hours or up to overnight before baking. (The unbaked dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.)

6. Preheat the oven to 350°F and position a rack in the center of the oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

7. Drop the dough in ¼-cup scoops onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, rotating the baking sheet midway through the baking time, until the cookies are just starting to crack on the edges and the centers are soft but not liquidy when you press them.

8. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet on a wire rack for 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer them to the rack and let cool completely.
