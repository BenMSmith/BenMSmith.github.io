MST3k is back for season 13! In the spirit of the Invention Exchange, I decided to try and come up with a cookie (or bar or small dessert) for each of this season’s films. Rather than riffing on the title alone, I’m going to figure out each recipe *after* I’ve seen the episode, so that it can be based on the nature of the movie itself.

The first episode is *Santo &amp; the Treasure of Dracula*, a lucha libre film with a wacky mixed-up plot that involves past-life regression, vampires, and, of course, El Santo, our luchador who’s also an inventor, scientist, and international bon vivant.

Mexican hot chocolate felt like a fun starting point for this. I love the combo of chocolate and chile, and it also ties in nicely with the movie’s *spicy* history – in addition to the cut seen on the show, there was also the European cut that featured alternate scenes with more see-through negligees.

I wanted to do a shortbread cookie here, so that these could be oval luchador-mask shaped cookies with some structure, and the chopped-up chocolate kind of looks like the eye, nose, and mouth holes in a typical luchador mask.

I thought I had ancho chile powder on hand, but it was actually *chipotle* chile powder. That added a nice smoky edge, but you could also probably use half as much cayenne here. The only thing you don’t want to use here is *chili* powder – that’s typically a mix of spices that’s not going play well with chocolate.
