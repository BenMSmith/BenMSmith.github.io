It had to be done.

This sketch, y'all. I didn't know the show could get this _dark_ and I loved it.  

I haven't done a pie yet (despite it being one of my favorite baking genres), so I'm going to give tribute to what happened here with a pie that (much like the roast) starts out nutty and finishes black.  It's a black-bottom peanut butter pie that's extra black on the bottom with some chocolate cookie crumbs.

First up: supplies.

We've got an understudy here - I picked the wrong moment to try and get corn syrup from the store (AKA pecan pie season), so honey got swapped in instead since I only needed a few tablespoons.

Spray 9-inch-diameter a glass pie dish with nonstick spray. 

While your oven heats to 350, blend cookie crumbs, melted butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar in processor until moist clumps form.

Press crumb mixture over bottom and up sides of prepared pie dish. Bake crust until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.

</p>

While this bakes, combine chocolate, 2/3 cup cream, corn syrup, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium heat until chocolate softens, about 3 minutes. Whisk until melted and smooth. Spread chocolate mixture over bottom of crust. Freeze 10 minutes.

While that's chilling, in another bowl, microwave your peanut butter, powdered sugar, and 3/4 cup cream in large microwave-safe bowl on medium heat at 15-second intervals just until chips soften, stirring often. Whisk in peanut butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Cool that until it's barely lukewarm. 

While that cools, beat remaining 1 cup cream and 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl until very thick but not yet holding any peaks. Fold _that_ into the peanut butter mixture in 3 additions.

Spoon mousse over chocolate layer, then smooth that with an offset spatula and add any peaks/decoration. Chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.  Your patience _will_ be rewarded.
