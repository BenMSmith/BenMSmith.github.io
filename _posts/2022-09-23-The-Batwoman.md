Well, that was an unexpected hiatus.

I had this movie's cookie worked out pretty much as soon as I saw the boat in the movie, and then work/life took over and didn't leave me any time to actually _bake_ them. The callback to _Reptilicus_ (and this series' namesake, "Every Country Has a Monster") immediately had me thinking of how to try and mashup Denmark and some kind of Mexican/Latin American flavors.

Denmark was obvious: ~~sewing supplies~~ butter cookies

[danish butter cookie tin]

Figuring out the latin half of these was trickier, until I remembered Alfajores.  They aren't explicitly Mexican (like our movie was), but they felt similar enough to a butter cookie, and making sandwich cookies with butter cookies and some cajeta (aka goat milk caramel) felt like the perfect salute to this movie's transliteration of Batman into...whatever that was.

And so we bake!
