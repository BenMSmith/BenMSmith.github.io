### More Information

Hello!  I’m Ben Smith.

I’m a software engineer (focusing in professional services and connecting internal and external systems) who cooks, bakes, solves puzzles, and co-hosts [a Eurovision podcast](https://www.eurowhat.com), though not always in that order.

I’m slightly too online, and I try to use to use those powers for good.  This site is for collecting my brain.
