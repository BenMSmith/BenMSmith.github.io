If you're reading this, it's likely because I re-posted the link to Twitter after another Event happened.

Here's where to find me, when Twitter platform ceases to exist in a way where you no longer feel like posting there:

## Stuff I Make

- Mike McComb and I make [The Eurowhat? podcast](https://www.eurowhat.com), where the two of us take on 65+ years of Eurovision and try to make some sort of sense of it.  It's a real nice party and we've got some cool stuff we're working on for 2023.
- This website you're already on (goodatinter.net) is for general blogging/baking projects/photos/etc. and it has RSS if you want to pop it into feedly
- I've also got a project I'm cooking up for next year that will eventually live at vortexlibr.is once it's started.  Nothing's there yet, but see you there soonâ„¢.

*Please invite me to guest on your podcast!*  I like chatting about things (particularly trivia, the Eurovision Song Contest, puzzles, Mystery Science Theater, and general pop culture/current events) and I have my own microphone.

## We'll See What Sparks Joy ("Social" Media)

- [Tumblr](https://thatbenmsmith.tumblr.com/) is mostly where I re-blog stuff from other Tumblrs ATM.
- Facebook and I have a complicated relationship right now and I'm trying to use it less
- I'm on instagram at [bsideboston](https://www.instagram.com/bsideboston/), say hi and don't be weird, it's mostly pictures of food and puzzles ATM.
- Like many other elder millenials I have made a [Cohost](https://cohost.org/BenMSmith) but I don't know what I'm going to use that for yet.
- Mastodon is definitely filling the void of Twitter for now. I'm @BenMSmith@mastodon.cloud. See you there!
- A wild [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/benmsmith.bsky.social) has appeared. No, I do not have invites yet.
- Threads? LOL. LMAO.

## A newsletter?  In this economy?
- If you're a substack kind of person, I have made [Semaphore](https://bsideboston.substack.com/) for occasional updates and also to ruin the other Ben Smith's SEO.
